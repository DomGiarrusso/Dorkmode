### About the theme

This theme was created because I really liked the [GitHub Dark theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme). Though as you may have guessed I had my own issues with the theme. I decided to recreate the theme into my own image. I used many of the same colors found in GitHub's theme but changed into something I find more appealing.

### Inspiration and Tools

-   [GitHub's Dark Default theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)
-   [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) gave me the scaffolding for the project
-   [Theme Studio for VS Code](https://themes.vscode.one/) helped me quickly design out the main coloring of the theme and visualize it.
    > [!NOTE]
    > I added more variables not found part of Theme Studio

### Support and Suggestions

If you need any help or suggestions for the theme feel free to reach out. Making a VS Code theme is tedious and I might have missed a variable or some part feels off.
