## Motivations

This theme was created because I really liked the [GitHub Dark theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme). Though as you may have guessed I had my own issues with the theme. I decided to recreate the theme into my own image. I used many of the same colors found in GitHub's theme but changed into something I find more appealing.

### Inspiration and Tools

- [GitHub's Dark Default theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)
- [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) gave me the scaffolding for the project
- [Theme Studio for VS Code](https://themes.vscode.one/) helped me quickly design out the main coloring of the theme and visualize it.

> [!NOTE]
> I added more variables not found part of Theme Studio
